Refusing to acknowledge someone's presence can be a sign of disrespect or even a sign of aggression. It can be an effective way of communicating that you do not want to interact with the person, but it can also be seen as dismissive, rude, and even hostile. It can also be a way of avoiding an uncomfortable situation or conversation. Refusing to acknowledge someone's presence can be a sign that you are not interested in engaging with them, or that you do not wish to discuss something. It can also be a way of protecting yourself from potential harm. Ultimately, refusing to acknowledge someone's presence can be seen as a form of passive aggression, and it is important to be mindful of the implications of this behavior.
