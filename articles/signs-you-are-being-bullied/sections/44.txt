Refusing to help someone when they need it can be a difficult decision to make. It is important to consider the situation, your own capabilities, and the potential consequences before making a decision. It can be tempting to want to help, especially when someone is in need, but it is important to remember that you have the right to say no. It is important to be honest and respectful when refusing to help someone. Explain why you are unable to help and try to offer alternative solutions if possible. Refusing to help someone does not make you a bad person, it simply means that you are taking care of yourself and your own needs first.
