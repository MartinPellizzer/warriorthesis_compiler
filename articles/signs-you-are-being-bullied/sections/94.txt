Following the victim around can be a very dangerous and intimidating experience for the victim. It can cause the victim to feel scared, anxious, and helpless. Victims may start to feel like they are being watched or monitored, and that their every move is being tracked. This can be especially true if the perpetrator has access to the victim's daily routine or whereabouts. Following the victim can also be a form of harassment and a way for the perpetrator to gain control over the victim. Victims may start to feel like they have no escape or safe place. It is important for victims to know that they have rights and that they should reach out to someone they trust if they feel they are in danger. It is also important for victims to take steps to protect themselves, such as changing their daily routine or avoiding certain places. By taking these steps, victims can help protect themselves and take back control of their lives.
