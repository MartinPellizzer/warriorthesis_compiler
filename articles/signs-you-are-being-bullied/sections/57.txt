Making fun of someone's name is a mean-spirited and hurtful thing to do. It's not funny and it can make someone feel embarrassed and ashamed. It can also lead to bullying, as it can give someone a false sense of superiority. It's important to remember that everyone's name is special and unique to them, and it's a reflection of their culture and identity. If you don't like someone's name, it's best to keep your thoughts to yourself and not make fun of it. Everyone deserves to be respected and feel good about who they are, and making fun of someone's name can take away from that.
