Teasing someone in a way that is hurtful or humiliating is never okay. It can have a lasting, damaging effect on the person who is being teased, not only in the moment but for a long time afterwards. Teasing that is intended to make someone feel bad about themselves can lead to feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem. It can also lead to anxiety and depression. If you ever feel like you have to tease someone in order to get a laugh, think twice. Instead of making someone feel bad, why not try to make them feel good? Compliment them, make them laugh, or just be kind. It's much more rewarding in the end.
