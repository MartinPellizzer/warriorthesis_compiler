Making hurtful jokes can have a negative impact on those around you. Not only can they cause emotional distress, they can also make people feel excluded or uncomfortable in social situations. It's important to remember that even if you don't mean to be hurtful, your words can still have a lasting effect on those around you. Instead of making jokes at someone else's expense, try to focus on making positive, uplifting jokes that bring people together instead of tearing them down. Additionally, if you hear someone else making a hurtful joke, don't be afraid to speak up and let them know that it's not okay. By doing so, you can help create a safe, welcoming environment for everyone.
