Making someone feel guilty or ashamed can be a very powerful tool in manipulating someone to do something or to think a certain way. It can be subtle, like a comment about how someone should feel bad for not helping out more, or it can be more overt, such as threatening to tell someone's secrets if they don't comply. Guilt and shame can be used to manipulate someone into doing things that they don't want to do, or to make them feel bad about something that they have done. Guilt and shame can also be used to control people, as it can be used to make them feel like they are not good enough. Guilt and shame can be used to manipulate someone into feeling like they owe someone else something, or to make them feel like they have to do something to make up for something they have done. It is important to be aware of how powerful guilt and shame can be, and to be aware of how it can be used to manipulate someone.
