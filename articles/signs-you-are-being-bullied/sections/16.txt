Strangling is a form of asphyxiation that involves compressing the neck of a person, usually with two hands, in order to cut off the air supply. It is considered a violent act and is illegal in most countries. Strangling can be fatal, and those who survive the experience often suffer long-term physical and psychological effects. Strangling can be done with a variety of objects, including bare hands, clothes, ropes, and other materials. It is important for people to be aware of the risks of strangling and to take steps to protect themselves from this form of violence. It is also important to seek help if you have been a victim of strangling or if you know someone who has been a victim. There are resources available to help victims of strangling and to help prevent future incidents.
