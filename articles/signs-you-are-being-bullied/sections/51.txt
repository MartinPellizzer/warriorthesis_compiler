Using racial epithets is never acceptable. They are hurtful and offensive words that carry a long history of oppression and racism. They are used to dehumanize and degrade people of color and should be avoided at all costs. The use of racial epithets is wrong and can have long-term effects on the people they are used against. Not only do they create an environment of hostility and intolerance, but they can also lead to feelings of shame and humiliation. Beyond that, they can lead to physical or emotional harm if they are used in a threatening or aggressive manner. We must all be aware of the impact of using these words and take responsibility for our language. We must strive to create an inclusive and respectful environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, or background.
