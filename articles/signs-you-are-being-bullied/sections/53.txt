Excluding people of a certain race from activities is a form of discrimination that has no place in our society. It is wrong to deny someone access to an activity or opportunity based solely on their race, and it sends a message that a certain group of people are not welcome or valued. This type of exclusion can lead to feelings of isolation and alienation, and can have a lasting negative impact on both individuals and communities. By creating a culture of inclusion and acceptance, we can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate and succeed in activities, regardless of their race. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, and to have the chance to pursue their passions.
