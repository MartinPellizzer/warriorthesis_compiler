Refusing to hire someone because of their race is wrong and has no place in the workplace. It is an act of discrimination that can cause serious harm to an individual. Not only is it illegal, but it also goes against the values of fairness and equality that many employers strive to uphold. It can also create an environment of mistrust and fear, leading to low morale and decreased productivity. Everyone should be judged based on their abilities and qualifications, regardless of their race. Employers should strive to create an inclusive and equitable workplace, where everyone is treated with respect and dignity. This is the only way to ensure that everyone has the same opportunity to succeed.
