Yelling or screaming at someone is never an acceptable form of communication. It can be incredibly damaging to the recipient and can lead to feelings of fear, shame, and worthlessness. It can also cause long-term emotional and psychological damage, and can lead to a breakdown in communication and trust. Yelling or screaming can be a sign of an underlying problem, such as stress, anger, or frustration. It is important to take a step back and look at the underlying problem and address it in a constructive way. If yelling or screaming is the only way to communicate, it is important to apologize and try to find healthier ways to express yourself.
