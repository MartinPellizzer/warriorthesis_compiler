Refusing to associate with someone due to their religious beliefs is an issue that has been around for centuries, and it is still a problem today. It is wrong to judge someone based on their religious beliefs, and doing so could lead to discrimination and even violence. People should be allowed to practice their faith without fear of judgement or persecution. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, and it is important to respect those beliefs, no matter how different they may be from your own. It is also important to remember that even if you disagree with someone's beliefs, you can still be respectful and open-minded in your interactions with them. Refusing to associate with someone based on their religious beliefs is not only wrong, but it can also have serious consequences.
