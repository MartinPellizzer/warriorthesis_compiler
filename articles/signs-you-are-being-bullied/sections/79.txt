Asking intrusive questions about someone's religion can be seen as offensive and disrespectful. It is important to remember that people's beliefs and religious practices are deeply personal and should not be brought up unless the person initiates the conversation. A better approach is to ask open-ended questions about the person's faith and let them decide how much they wish to share. If you are unsure of how to phrase a question, it is best to ask the person if they are comfortable discussing their beliefs with you. It is also important to be respectful of the person's beliefs and not to make assumptions or judgments. Asking intrusive questions about someone's religion can be seen as a violation of their privacy, so it is important to be mindful and courteous when engaging in conversations about faith.
