Making someone feel like they don't belong is a cruel and damaging thing to do. It can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and even depression. It can also lead to a lack of self-esteem and a sense of worthlessness. Everyone should be made to feel like they belong, regardless of their background, beliefs, or lifestyle. We all have something to contribute, and we should be encouraged to do so. We should all strive to make everyone feel included, heard, and respected. Everyone deserves to feel like they belong and that they have something valuable to offer. Let's all make it our mission to ensure everyone feels like they are part of the group.
