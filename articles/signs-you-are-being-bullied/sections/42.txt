Publicly embarrassing someone is never a good idea. It can be extremely hurtful and damaging to someone's self-esteem, especially if it is done in front of a large group of people. It can cause feelings of shame, humiliation, and embarrassment, and can even lead to depression and anxiety. It is important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and it is not okay to publicly shame someone for it. Instead, it is better to talk to them privately and work together to find a solution. Additionally, it is important to be mindful of the power dynamics and privilege that can be at play when publicly embarrassing someone, as it can be used as a form of bullying. If you find yourself in a situation where someone is being publicly embarrassed, it is important to stand up for them and show support.
