It is never okay to make someone feel like they are not good enough. Everyone has unique skills and talents, and it is important to recognize and celebrate these differences. When someone is made to feel like they are not good enough, it can have a lasting impact on their self-esteem and mental health. It is important to be mindful of our words and actions, and to make sure we are not making someone feel inferior. Instead, it is important to focus on building people up and helping them to realize their potential. Showing kindness and compassion goes a long way, and can help to create an environment of mutual respect and understanding.
