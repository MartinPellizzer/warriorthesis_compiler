Making derogatory comments is never acceptable. It can be hurtful and damaging to the person it is directed at and can lead to a decrease in self-esteem, confidence and even depression. It can also create an atmosphere of fear, distrust and hostility, leading to further negative interactions. It is important to be mindful of what we say and how we say it, and to think before we speak. We should also be mindful of how our comments might be interpreted by others, and take responsibility for our words. If we make a mistake, we should take the time to apologize and make amends. Ultimately, it is important to practice kindness and respect in all of our interactions.
