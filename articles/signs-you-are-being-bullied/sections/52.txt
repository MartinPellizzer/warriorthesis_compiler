Refusing to associate with people of a particular race is an act of discrimination and should not be tolerated. It is wrong to judge someone based on their skin color, ethnicity, or any other physical characteristic. Everyone should be treated equally and given the same opportunities. Refusing to associate with someone because of their race can have negative consequences, such as creating a hostile environment and perpetuating negative stereotypes. It can also lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion, which can have a profound effect on someone's mental health and wellbeing. We must stand together and reject any form of discrimination and strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.
