Sending explicit messages or texts can be a fun way to spice up your relationship, but there are some important things to consider before doing so. First, make sure that you are both comfortable with the idea. Explicit messages or texts should never be used as a form of coercion. Second, make sure that the messages or texts are kept private. Sending explicit messages or texts to someone who you don't know well or who may not be comfortable with the idea can be very dangerous. Finally, consider the consequences of sending explicit messages or texts. If the recipient is underage, for example, you could be subject to legal action. Before sending explicit messages or texts, make sure you understand the risks.
