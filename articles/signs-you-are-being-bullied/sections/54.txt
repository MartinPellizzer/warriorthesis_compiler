Making assumptions about someone's intelligence based on their race is a dangerous and misguided practice. It's a form of prejudice that can lead to misunderstandings and even damage to relationships. No one should be judged on their race or ethnicity, as everyone is capable of learning and growing. It's important to remember that intelligence is not a fixed trait; it can be developed over time. People of all backgrounds have the capacity to acquire knowledge and skills, and to use them to their advantage. Instead of making assumptions, it's better to get to know someone and assess their intelligence based on their individual merits and capabilities. Doing so will help to create a more inclusive and understanding environment.
