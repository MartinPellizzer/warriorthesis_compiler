Criticizing someone for not being "feminine" or "masculine" enough is wrong and damaging. Everyone has the right to express their gender identity in the way that is most comfortable and authentic to them. Gender roles are social constructs and should not be used to judge people or dictate how they should behave. People should not be made to feel ashamed of their gender expression, whether it is considered traditionally masculine, feminine, or something in between. Everyone should be free to express themselves in whatever way they feel is right for them, without fear of judgement or criticism.
