It is never okay to tell someone they are going to hell for not believing in a certain religion. Everyone has the right to believe what they want and it is wrong to make someone feel guilty or scared for not believing in something they don't feel is right for them. Every religion has its own set of beliefs and it is important to be respectful of everyone's beliefs, no matter how different they may be from our own. It is also important to remember that it is not our place to judge someone else's beliefs or to try to convert them to our own. We should all strive to be accepting of others and their beliefs, and to respect each other's right to believe what they want.
