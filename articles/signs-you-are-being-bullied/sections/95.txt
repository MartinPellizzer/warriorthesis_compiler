Intimidation can be a powerful tool used to control and manipulate a victim. It can take many forms, one of which is the use of physical size or strength. This type of intimidation can be extremely intimidating and can be used to coerce a victim into doing something they would not normally do. It can be as simple as someone looming over a victim, or it can be more extreme, such as using physical strength to force a victim to do something. This type of intimidation can be extremely damaging to a victim, both emotionally and physically, and can have long-lasting effects. It is important to remember that no one should ever feel threatened or forced to do something they do not want to do.
