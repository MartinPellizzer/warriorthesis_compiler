Refusing to allow someone to use the restroom of their gender identity is not only wrong, it is a form of discrimination. People should be allowed to use the restroom of their gender identity without fear of being judged or rejected. Allowing people to use the restroom of their gender identity is a sign of acceptance and respect, and it helps to create a safe and inclusive environment. It is important to remember that gender identity is not always the same as a person's assigned sex at birth, and everyone should be able to use the restroom of the gender they identify with without fear of discrimination. Refusing to allow someone to use the restroom of their gender identity sends a message that they are not welcome or accepted, and it should not be tolerated.
