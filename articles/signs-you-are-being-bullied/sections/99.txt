Making the victim feel unwelcome or unsafe is a serious form of abuse that can have a lasting impact on the victim's mental and emotional well-being. It can involve anything from verbal and emotional abuse to physical aggression. Victims may feel isolated, scared, and helpless in the face of this type of abuse, and it can take a toll on their self-esteem and sense of safety. Victims may also experience depression, anxiety, and fear of future abuse. It is important for those affected by this type of abuse to seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or professional counselor. It is also important to remember that no one deserves to be made to feel unwelcome or unsafe in any situation.
