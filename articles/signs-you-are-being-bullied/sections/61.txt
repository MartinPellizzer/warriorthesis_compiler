Unwanted touching or sexual advances are never okay. No one should ever feel uncomfortable or unsafe in any situation. It is important to remember that everyone has the right to their own personal space and to be respected. Any form of unwanted touching or sexual advances can make someone feel violated and disrespected, and can be considered a form of sexual harassment or assault. It is important to be aware of your own boundaries and to respect the boundaries of others. If you are ever in a situation where someone is making you feel uncomfortable, it is important to speak up and to make it clear that their advances are not welcome. Remember that you have the right to be respected and safe in any situation.
