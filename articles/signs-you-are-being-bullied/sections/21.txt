Making fun of someone's interests or hobbies is never a good idea. Not only is it hurtful, but it can also lead to lasting damage to the relationship. It's important to remember that everyone has different interests and hobbies, and no one should be judged or made fun of for what they enjoy doing. Instead, it's best to show respect and support for those activities, even if you don't understand or appreciate them. It's a great way to show that you care and that you value the person's interests.
