Let me give you one last tip to know 100% if someone is bullying you.

If someone engage in any of the above listed behaviors, simply tell them that you don't like that behavior and ask them to stop.

If they stop, there's a chance they were not bullying you. Maybe they were aggressive just because they had a bad day. Who knows. Who cares. Just move on with your life.

But, if they don't stop, and they persist with their abusive assaults in the future, then you can be 100% sure they are bullying you and you must not tolerate it.
