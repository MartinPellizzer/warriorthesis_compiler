Workplace bullying is an unfortunate reality for many employees. It can be a difficult and uncomfortable situation to deal with, but it is important to remember that you are not alone. There are steps you can take to help protect yourself and your career. First, it is important to document any incidents of bullying. Keep detailed records of the dates, times, and witnesses to any bullying behavior. This can be invaluable evidence should you need to take further action. Additionally, it is important to speak up and report any bullying behavior to your manager or human resources department. Bullying is not acceptable and should not be tolerated. Finally, if the bullying persists, it may be necessary to seek legal advice. It is important to remember that you have rights, and no one should be made to feel unsafe in the workplace.
