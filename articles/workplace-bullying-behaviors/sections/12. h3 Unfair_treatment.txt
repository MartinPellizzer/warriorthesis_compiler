No one should have to experience unfair treatment in the workplace, especially in the form of bullying behaviors. It can be incredibly difficult to cope with the stress and anxiety that comes with feeling like you are being treated unfairly. It can be even more difficult to speak up about it. It's important to remember that you are not alone and that there are resources available to help you. It's important to reach out to a trusted colleague, friend, or family member and to talk to a professional if needed. Your workplace should be a safe and supportive environment and if it is not, it is important to take the steps necessary to ensure that it is.
