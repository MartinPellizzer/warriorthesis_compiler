Working in an environment where unreasonable demands are placed on you can be incredibly stressful and damaging to your morale. Unreasonable demands can come in many forms, such as excessive workloads, unrealistic deadlines, or unreasonable expectations. In the workplace, these demands can be used as a form of bullying, as the person making the demands is attempting to control and intimidate the person receiving them. It's important to remember that no one should be subjected to this kind of treatment and that it's not your fault if it happens to you. It's essential to speak up and seek help if you feel you're being subjected to unreasonable demands or any other form of workplace bullying. Having a supportive network of colleagues and a strong HR department can help you to feel empowered to stand up for yourself and your rights. Remember, you deserve to work in a safe, respectful, and supportive environment.
