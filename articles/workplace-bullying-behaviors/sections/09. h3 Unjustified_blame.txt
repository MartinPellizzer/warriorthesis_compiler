Unjustified blame is a common form of workplace bullying. It can be incredibly disheartening and demoralizing to be on the receiving end of blame that is not deserved. It is important to remember that this behavior is not your fault and that you should not take it personally. It can be difficult to stay positive and to not internalize the blame, but it is important to remember that you have the right to stand up for yourself and to speak out against this type of bullying. It is also important to remember that you are not alone and that there are resources available to help you cope and to protect yourself.
