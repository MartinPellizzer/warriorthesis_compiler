Unwarranted criticism in the workplace can be an incredibly difficult thing to deal with, especially when it is coming from a superior. It can be hard to not take it personally and to not internalize the criticism, especially when it is not constructive. Bullying behaviors in the workplace can be particularly damaging, as they can lead to feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem, and even depression. It is important to remember that no matter how difficult it may seem, you are not alone. There are resources available to help you cope with such criticism, and it is important to take the time to find the support you need so that you can move forward in a positive way. It is also important to remember that you are valuable and that your opinion matters. Do not let anyone make you feel otherwise.
