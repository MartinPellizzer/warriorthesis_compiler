Workplace bullying is a serious problem that can have far-reaching negative impacts on both individuals and organizations. Bullying behaviors can range from verbal abuse, such as name-calling and belittling remarks, to physical aggression, such as pushing and hitting. These behaviors can cause immense psychological distress, lower self-esteem, and lead to physical health issues. They can also lead to decreased productivity, higher absenteeism, and higher turnover rates. It is important for organizations to recognize the signs of workplace bullying and take steps to address the issue. By creating a safe and supportive environment for employees, organizations can create a positive workplace culture and help ensure the wellbeing of their staff.
