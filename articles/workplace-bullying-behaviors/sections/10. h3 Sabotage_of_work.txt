Sabotage of work is a form of workplace bullying that can be incredibly damaging and demoralizing. It can take the form of a colleague deliberately undermining your work, sabotaging your projects, or withholding information that you need to do your job properly. It can be hard to recognize sabotage when it is happening, especially when it is done subtly. It is important to remember that you are not alone and that there are ways to handle this situation. If you feel like you are being sabotaged, take the time to talk to someone you trust and make sure you document any instances of sabotage. By recognizing and addressing sabotage in the workplace, you can help to create a more supportive and productive environment for everyone.
