Exclusion and isolation are two of the most damaging workplace bullying behaviors that can be experienced. They can leave a person feeling isolated, unheard, and unseen. It can be difficult to feel like you don't belong, like you're not part of the team. It can be even more difficult to speak up and ask for help. But it's important to remember that you are not alone. There are many people who are experiencing the same feelings and emotions. It can be helpful to reach out to a trusted friend or colleague, or even a mental health professional. You don't have to face this alone. Together, we can create a workplace where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued.
