Public humiliation is a form of workplace bullying that can have lasting effects on an individual's self-confidence and morale. It is a behavior that should never be tolerated in the workplace and is unfortunately all too common. It can take many forms, such as belittling comments, public criticism, or even exclusion. No one should ever have to feel embarrassed or ashamed in their workplace. If you or someone you know is being subjected to public humiliation, it is important to speak up and take action. Talk to a trusted colleague or supervisor, or seek help from a professional. There are resources available to help you address this issue and create a safe and respectful work environment. Even though it can be difficult to speak up, it is essential to stand up for yourself and others in order to create a workplace free from bullying.
