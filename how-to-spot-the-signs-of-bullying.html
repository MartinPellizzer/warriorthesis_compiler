            Introduction
        </h2>

        <p>Bullying is a form of aggressive behavior that is often intentional, typically repeated, and involves an
            imbalance of power. It can take many forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, and cyberbullying.
            Bullying can have serious and lasting effects on victims, so it is important to be aware of the signs of
            bullying and take action if you suspect someone is being bullied.

            Physical Signs of Bullying

        <p>
            Physical signs of bullying can include unexplained injuries, bruises or cuts, and torn or missing
            clothing.
            If a child is being physically bullied, they may be reluctant to tell anyone, so it is important to look
            out
            for any physical signs that may indicate bullying is occurring.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Behavioral Signs of Bullying
        </h2>
        <p>
            Behavioral signs of bullying can include changes in eating habits, withdrawal from social activities,
            loss
            of interest in school or activities, low self-esteem, and unexplained anxiety or fear. If a child is
            being
            bullied, they may become withdrawn and isolated, so it is important to look out for any changes in their
            behavior that could indicate bullying.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Emotional Signs of Bullying

            of
            concentration, avoidance of social situations, and suicidal thoughts. If a child is being bullied, they
            may
            become increasingly anxious and depressed, so it is important to look out for any emotional signs that
            may
            indicate bullying is occurring.

            grades, and fear of passing by certain areas. If a child is being bullied in school, they may become
            increasingly reluctant to attend school, so it is important to look out for any signs that may indicate
            bullying is occurring.
