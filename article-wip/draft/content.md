Headaches? Anxiety? Lack of motivation?

What if I tell you that workplace bullying can have these effects (and many more) on you?

Workplace bullying is a scourge that affects millions of employees worldwide, leading to devastating consequences for their mental and physical health, job satisfaction, and productivity. It's a vicious cycle that can leave employees feeling isolated, helpless, and vulnerable, while also wreaking havoc on their personal and professional lives.

Studies have shown that bullying in the workplace can lead to a wide range of effects, such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD, to name a few. For example, a survey conducted by the Workplace Bullying Institute revealed that over 60% of employees who were bullied suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, while over 40% reported depression and feelings of hopelessness.

Furthermore, the effects of workplace bullying can extend to physical health, causing headaches, digestive issues, and sleep disorders. In fact, a study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that employees who were bullied were twice as likely to experience sleep disturbances than those who weren't.

Despite these alarming statistics and studies, workplace bullying continues to be a pervasive problem, often ignored or dismissed by management.

It's time for employees to speak up and demand change, to create a safe and healthy work environment where bullying is not tolerated.

In this post, we'll explore 27 devastating workplace bullying effects for employees, including real-life examples that illustrate the harsh reality of this issue. It's time to raise awareness, to stand up for ourselves and our colleagues, and to demand a workplace free of bullying and harassment.


## What is workplace bullying

Just so we are on the same page, let me give you a quick intro on what is workplace bullying.

Workplace bullying is a form of harassment that involves the repeated mistreatment, abuse, or humiliation of an individual by one or more colleagues or supervisors. It can take many forms, including verbal abuse, physical intimidation, and social exclusion, and it can cause significant emotional distress, depression, anxiety, and even physical health problems.

According to a survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute, 19% of American workers reported experiencing workplace bullying. This means that nearly one in five employees has been subjected to this form of abuse.

Additionally, a study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found that workplace bullying was associated with increased rates of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among employees.

Examples of workplace bullying can range from subtle to overt:

- It could be a supervisor consistently making unreasonable demands or assigning tasks that are impossible to complete.
- It could be a colleague constantly interrupting or belittling others during meetings or making sarcastic comments.
- It could also be a manager spreading rumors or gossip about an employee, or purposely excluding them from meetings or social events.

Studies have shown that workplace bullying not only affects the individual being bullied but also the entire workplace culture. It creates a toxic environment that can lead to high turnover rates, low employee morale, and decreased productivity.

## Physical Effects of Workplace Bullying

Body and mind are one and the same. If the mind suffer, the body pays the consequences too.

Research shows that victims of bullying are more likely to experience physical health issues such as headaches, sleep disturbances, and cardiovascular problems. According to a study by the Workplace Bullying Institute, 45% of bullying victims reported experiencing stress-related health problems.

This is unacceptable.

No employee should have to endure physical pain and discomfort simply because of someone else's cruel behavior. 

### Increased stress
Let's start with the obvious one. Workplace bullying can make your life a living hell, and the constant fear and anxiety can take a toll on your mental and physical health. This can manifest in physical symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping, leading to a vicious cycle of more stress and even worse health outcomes.

### High blood pressure
The prolonged exposure to stress caused by workplace bullying can cause blood pressure to rise, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. This is not something to take lightly. According to the American Heart Association, high blood pressure contributes to nearly 1,100 deaths per day.

### Digestive issues
Stress can wreak havoc on your digestive system, leading to problems such as irritable bowel syndrome, acid reflux, and stomach ulcers. These conditions can be painful, uncomfortable, and downright embarrassing. Who wants to deal with constant stomach pain and indigestion while trying to work?

### Chronic pain
Workplace bullying can lead to physical injuries such as muscle strains, sprains, and back pain. Chronic pain can affect daily life and lead to further stress and anxiety. It's not just about the physical pain; it's about the mental toll of dealing with pain day in and day out.

### Weakened immune system
Stress can weaken the immune system, making you more vulnerable to illnesses such as colds, flu, and infections. This means more sick days, more doctor's visits, and more stress on your body.

### Fatigue
Chronic stress and anxiety can lead to feelings of exhaustion and burnout, affecting productivity and overall health. It's hard to be productive when you're struggling to keep your eyes open.

### Skin problems
Stress can also affect the skin, leading to conditions such as acne, psoriasis, and eczema. These conditions can be painful, embarrassing, and difficult to treat.

### Headaches
Workplace bullying can cause frequent headaches, ranging from mild tension headaches to severe migraines. Headaches can be debilitating, making it hard to focus and function at work.

Stress can affect appetite and lead to weight gain or loss, which can have negative health consequences. This can contribute to a host of health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.





## Mental Effects of Workplace Bullying

If you believe that workplace bullying won't leave you with mental scars, think twice.

According to a study by the Workplace Bullying Institute, 80% of bullied employees experience anxiety, 45% experience depression, and 30% experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

These effects can lead to decreased job satisfaction, poor work performance, and even suicidal thoughts.

Examples of mental effects include, feeling constantly on edge,experiencing panic attacks, and losing confidence in one's abilities

It's essential for employers to take workplace bullying seriously and provide resources for employees to cope with the mental effects.

### Anxiety
Being bullied can cause a lot of anxiety in victims. They may feel worried or stressed about going to school or work and may have trouble sleeping or relaxing. According to a study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, 64% of students who were bullied reported feeling anxious.

### Depression
Victims of bullying may also experience depression. They may feel sad, hopeless, or helpless and may lose interest in activities they used to enjoy. They may also experience physical symptoms such as changes in appetite or sleep patterns. A study published in the Journal of School Health found that students who were bullied were more likely to experience depression than those who were not bullied.

### Shame and guilt
Victims of bullying may feel ashamed or guilty for being bullied. They may blame themselves for what is happening to them or feel like they did something to deserve it. This can lead to a cycle of self-blame and negative self-talk.

### Increased irritability and anger
Victims of bullying may feel angry or irritable as a result of being bullied. They may lash out at others or have trouble controlling their emotions. This can lead to conflicts with friends, family, and teachers.

### Difficulty concentrating
Victims of bullying may have trouble concentrating or focusing on tasks. They may also have trouble remembering things or retaining information. According to a study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology, students who were bullied had lower academic achievement than those who were not bullied.

### Loss of confidence and self-worth
Victims of bullying may also experience a loss of confidence and self-worth. They may feel like they are not capable of achieving their goals or that they do not deserve to be happy. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a decrease in academic and social performance.

### Feelings of helplessness or powerlessness

According to a study published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress, students who were bullied were more likely to develop PTSD symptoms than those who were not bullied.





## Productivity Effects of Workplace Bullying

More bullying equals less conentration and less concentration equals less productivity.

Is as straight as that.

Research shows that employees who experience bullying are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and stress, which can lead to decreased productivity and increased absenteeism.

Also, a study by the Workplace Bullying Institute found that almost 50% of targeted employees reported that they experienced health problems as a result of workplace bullying.

This can create a hostile work environment that undermines team morale and cooperation, hindering productivity across the board.

### Reduced work performance
When you're feeling stressed, it can be hard to focus on your tasks and stay on top of your game. You may feel distracted by personal problems, overwhelmed by your workload, or simply burnt out. As a result, your work performance may suffer, leaving you feeling frustrated and demoralized. In fact, a study by the American Institute of Stress found that job stress costs US businesses over $300 billion annually in lost productivity.

### Reduced quality of work
When you're under a lot of stress, you may rush through your work or make careless mistakes. This can lead to a decrease in the quality of your work, which can be especially damaging if you're in a field that requires precision and attention to detail. For example, a surgeon who is stressed out may make a critical error during an operation, putting the patient's life at risk.

### Increased errors
As we just mentioned, stressed employees are more prone to making mistakes. This could include errors in data entry, calculations, or other important tasks. Even a small mistake could have serious consequences, such as a typo in a legal document that could lead to a lawsuit.

### Decreased motivation
When you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, it's hard to stay motivated and focused on your goals. You may feel like you're just going through the motions, rather than putting your best effort into your work. This can lead to a decrease in productivity and overall performance, leaving you feeling like you're stuck in a rut.

### Increased absenteeism
If you're experiencing workplace stress, you may find yourself taking more sick days or other forms of leave. This could be due to physical symptoms of stress, such as headaches or stomachaches, or due to mental health concerns. According to a study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, stress-related absences cost US employers an average of $602 per employee per year.

### Reduced creativity
Stress can also stifle creativity and innovation. When you're feeling stressed, you may not have the mental energy or inspiration to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. This could be especially damaging if you work in a creative field, such as advertising or graphic design.

### Decreased collaboration
When you're stressed out, you may become more irritable or impatient with your colleagues. This can lead to a breakdown in communication and collaboration between team members, which can have serious consequences for the success of a project. For example, if you're not communicating effectively with your team, you may miss an important deadline or deliver a subpar product.

### Poor customer service
If you're feeling stressed or unmotivated, it may show in the way you interact with customers. You may not provide the level of customer service that is expected of you, which could result in dissatisfied customers and lost business. According to a study by NewVoiceMedia, US businesses lose $62 billion annually due to poor customer service.

### Increased use of sick days or medical leave
We've already mentioned this one, but it bears repeating. If you're experiencing workplace stress, you may find yourself taking more time off work due to physical or mental health concerns. This can be a vicious cycle, as taking time off work can lead to even more stress and anxiety about falling behind on your tasks.
