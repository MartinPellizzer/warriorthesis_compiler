It creates a toxic environment that can lead to high turnover rates, low employee morale, and decreased productivity.</p><h2 id="2">Signs of Workplace Bullying</h2><img class="post-img" alt="Signs of Workplace Bullying" title="Signs of Workplace Bullying" src="./images/workplace-bullying-effects/signs-of-workplace-bullying.jpg" /><p>Feel like a target at work?
