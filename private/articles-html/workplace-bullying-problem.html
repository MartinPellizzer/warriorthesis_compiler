    Workplace bullying is defined as repeated mistreatment by one or more employees that takes the form of verbal abuse,
    physical violence, or psychological intimidation. According to a 2017 survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute,
    19% of
    U.S. workers have experienced workplace bullying, and another 19% have witnessed it. Workplace bullying can occur at
    any
    level of an organization and can impact individuals in all industries.

    Workplace bullying can have significant consequences for both the individual and the organization. Individuals who
    experience workplace bullying may experience a range of negative outcomes, including decreased job satisfaction,
    decreased self-esteem, and physical and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. In some cases,
    workplace
    bullying can lead to individuals leaving their job or being terminated, resulting in financial instability and
    unemployment.

    Organizations that tolerate workplace bullying may experience a range of negative outcomes as well, including
    decreased
    productivity, decreased morale, and increased turnover rates. Additionally, organizations that do not address

    bullying may be subject to legal action, resulting in financial and reputational damage.

    Addressing Workplace Bullying

    Addressing workplace bullying requires a multi-faceted approach that involves both individuals and organizations.
    Individuals who experience workplace bullying should document the incidents and report them to a supervisor or human
    resources representative. It is essential to maintain a record of the incidents to support any potential legal
    action.

    Organizations can address workplace bullying by implementing policies that prohibit workplace bullying and by
    providing
    training to employees on how to recognize and report incidents of workplace bullying. Additionally, organizations
    should
    investigate all reports of workplace bullying promptly and take appropriate action, which may include disciplinary
    action against the bully.
