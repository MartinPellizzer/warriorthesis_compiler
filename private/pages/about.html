<p>Dear Warrior,
</p><p>I've been a Judo Sensei for 10 years now, and I've seen it all.
</p><p>Any form or bullying known to humankind. You name it. I saw it.
</p><p>I still remember when I was a kid. My first day at the Dojo. I was thrilled.
</p><p>Judo, as a martial art, was very competitive back then. At that time, we, as kid, only wanted to learn to fight. To become stronger. To learn the same cool moves whe saw on TV (you know, Karate movies and stuff).
</p><p>It was a blast...</p>
